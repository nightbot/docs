Here are the most common questions we get asked, all on one page. For additional support for specific items use the [Nightbot Forum](https://community.nightdev.com/c/nightbot) or the [Contact Form](https://www.nightdev.com/contact/) for more private matters.

### Why isn't Nightbot responding on YouTube Gaming?

Your stream must be live and public, also Nightbot needs to have been joined via the [control panel](https://beta.nightbot.tv/dashboard).

If Nightbot still isn't responding your channel, it's either not a moderator or is banned from your channel.

### My Playlist was deleted and I can't find it. How do I get it back?

Navigate to the [AutoDJ settings](https://beta.nightbot.tv/song_requests) and under the **General** Header change the **Playlist** setting to **Channel**. Personal playlists can be edited in the [Playlist](https://beta.nightbot.tv/song_requests/playlist) page.

### Why do I get songs in AutoDJ that can't be deleted?

There is another playlist active in the AutoDJ settings. Please refer to the previous question to change this.

### How do I get the current song to display on OBS/XSpilt?

Download and install the [Nightbot Application](https://docs.nightbot.tv/app-beta). Upon running song request, a text file is created with the current song in the `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Nightbot\` location for Windows and in `/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Nightbot/` for OSX.

### This isn't working and it should be. This should be added to Nightbot!

We are always looking to fix bugs and improve Nightbot, unreported bugs often go unnoticed. Contact us using the [Nightbot forum](https://community.nightdev.com/c/nightbot) or on Twitter at [@nightbotapp](https://twitter.com/nightbotapp).
