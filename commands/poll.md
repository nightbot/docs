The !poll command allows you and your moderators to easily create polls using [Straw Poll](https://strawpoll.com/).

## Creating a Poll

### Usage

> !poll new `title` | `option 1` | `option 2`

`title` is the main title of your poll.

`options` are the individual options your users can vote for. Split by a vertical bar `|`, 2 options are required, however, a maximum of 30 can be added.

### Example

> !poll new Should I bake a pizza? | yes | no | maybe

will return a new StrawPoll with options yes, no, and maybe:

> Night started a new poll: "Should I bake a pizza?" - Head to https://strawpoll.com/ABC123def456 to vote!
