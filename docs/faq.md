Here are the most common questions we get asked, all on one page. For additional support for specific items use the [Nightbot Forum](https://community.nightdev.com/c/nightbot) or the [Contact Form](https://nightdev.com/contact/) for more private matters.

### Why isn't Nightbot responding on YouTube?

Your stream must be live and public, also Nightbot needs to have been joined via the [control panel](https://nightbot.tv/dashboard).

If Nightbot still isn't responding your channel, it may not be a moderator or is banned from your channel.

Sometimes YouTube can also filter Nightbot's chat from "TopChat," so be sure you are looking at "Live Chat" and not "Top Chat."

If you operate a stream which is live 24/7, YouTube sometimes glitches and does not report your chat to Nightbot as live. As a temporary fix, restarting the stream does fix this issue.

### Why isn't Nightbot responding on Twitch?

Make sure Nightbot is joined to your chat in the control panel.

If you recently changed your Twitch username, be sure to logout and back into the Nightbot control panel. Parting and re-joining the bot via the control panel may also help.

If Nightbot still isn't responding your channel, it may not a moderator or is banned from your channel.

Lastly, sometimes users have accidentally blocked/ignored Nightbot. This causes Nightbot to not be seen by you (but can be seen by others). You can type `/unignore nightbot` in chat to unignore the bot.

### My Playlist was deleted and I can't find it. How do I get it back?

Navigate to the [Song Request settings](https://nightbot.tv/song_requests) and under the **General** Header change the **Playlist** setting to **Channel**. Personal playlists can be edited in the [Playlist](https://nightbot.tv/song_requests/playlist) page.

### Why do I get songs in Song Requests that can't be deleted?

There is another playlist active in the Song Request settings. Please refer to the previous question to change this.

### How do I get the current song to display on OBS/XSpilt?

Download and install the [Nightbot App](https://docs.nightbot.tv/app). Upon running song request, a text file is created with the current song in the `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Nightbot\` location for Windows and in `/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Nightbot/` for OSX.

### This isn't working and it should be. This should be added to Nightbot!
