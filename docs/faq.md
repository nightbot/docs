Here are the most common questions we get asked, all on one page. For additional support for specific items use the [NightDev Discord](https://discord.gg/nightdev) or the [Contact Form](https://nightdev.com/contact/) for more private matters.

### My Playlist was deleted and I can't find it. How do I get it back?

Navigate to the [Song Request settings](https://nightbot.tv/song_requests) and under the **General** Header change the **Playlist** setting to **Channel**. Personal playlists can be edited in the [Playlist](https://nightbot.tv/song_requests/playlist) page.

### Why do I get songs in Song Requests that can't be deleted?

There is another playlist active in the Song Request settings. Please refer to the previous question to change this.

### How do I get the current song to display on OBS/XSpilt?

Download and install the [Nightbot App](https://docs.nightbot.tv/app). Upon running song request, a text file is created with the current song in the `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Nightbot\` location for Windows and in `/Users/USERNAME/Documents/Nightbot/` for OSX.

### This isn't working and it should be. This should be added to Nightbot!

We are always looking to fix bugs and improve Nightbot. Reach out via the [NightDev Discord](https://discord.gg/nightdev)
