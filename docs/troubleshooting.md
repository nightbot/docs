Nightbot isn't responding in chat or returning a weird error? Try these troubleshooting steps first:

1. Go to [your Nightbot dashboard](https://nightbot.tv/dashboard) and fully log out of the Nightbot website. Once logged out, log back in.
  *This will restore Nightbot's access to your stream, and force update any new account information.*
2. On [your Nightbot dashboard](https://nightbot.tv/dashboard), click on the `Join Channel` button.
  *If you see `Nightbot Online` instead, first click on `Nightbot Online` -> `Leave Channel`.*

Doing these steps will automatically repair most problems.

> If you're still having trouble, also make sure:
> - Nightbot is a moderator in your chat.
> - Nightbot is not banned in your chat.
> - If you're on Twitch, Nightbot must not be blocked in chat. (Type `/unblock nightbot` in chat to unblock)
> - If you're on YouTube, your stream must be live. You may need to restart your stream if you operate a 24/7 stream.
> - If you're on YouTube, you must be looking at `Live Chat` not `Top Chat`
> - You can see if Nightbot is reading your chat by checking [chat logs](https://nightbot.tv/logs) (there's a slight delay on these logs, up to 60s).
